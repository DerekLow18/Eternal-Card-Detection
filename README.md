# Eternal-Card-Detection

This is a WIP card detection for the Eternal Card Game by Dire Wolf Digital. Hopefully,
by creating this and releasing it to the community, people will be able to make some
cool programs for the game!

Currently using OpenCV and tuning the program's card recognition abilities.

## Possible Functions and Applications
